title: How in the heck does the content manager make committs to the repository
  on my behalf?

  I linked netlify with github. looking at sources panel in developer tools,
  only the netlify domain is listed as a source. so obviously is hosting the
  decap cms. and the javascript which is doing that is cms.d8683.js 

  so clearly when i make changes here and click publish this javascript either talks to netlify.com or directly to github using my login -no it does not k now my login. so it talks to netlify server to tell it to publish. the netlify server then uses it github permissions to make the change to the repository.
